# Project Overview
In this project, we predict the winning of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL) for 2022/2021. 

# Project Steps
- Clean the match data and prepare it for machine learning using pandas.
- Use sci-kit-learn to build a model that predicts the winner of a match.
- Measure prediction accuracy and improve the model as necessary.

# Code

# Tech Stack
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for Python.

# File Overview:
`predictions.ipynb` - a Jupyter notebook that makes predictions about football match outcomes using a machine learning model.
local Setup:
No installation is required as the project was developed and executed in Google Colab.
