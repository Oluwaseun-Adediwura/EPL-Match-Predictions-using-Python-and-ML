# Project Overview
In this project, we predict the winner of football matches in the English Premier League (EPL).

# Project Steps
Clean the match data and prepare it for machine learning using pandas.
Use sci-kit-learn to build a model that predicts the winner of a match.
Measure prediction accuracy and improve the model as necessary.

# Code
You can find the code for this project [here].

# File Overview:
predictions.ipynb - a Jupyter notebook that makes predictions about football match outcomes using a machine learning model.

# Local Setup:
No installation is required as the project was developed and executed in Google Colab.

# Special Thanks
Special thanks to Vik Paruchuri for providing insights that helped in completing this project.
